const str = "Bwyan's Markdown Previwer\n================\n\nA React.js Project for Free Code Camp \n-------------------------------------\n\nThis page offers a brief overview of what it's like to use Markdown. Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by\nlooking at a few examples of it in action.\n\n**Note:** This document is itself written using Markdown.\n\n\n## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##\n\nA paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated\nby one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a\nblank line -- a line containing nothing spaces or tabs is considered\nblank.) Normal paragraphs should not be intended with spaces or tabs.\n\nMarkdown offers two styles of headers: *Setext* and *atx*.\nSetext-style headers for `<h1>` and `<h2>` are created by\n\"underlining\" with equal signs (`=`) and hyphens (`-`), respectively.\nTo create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (`#`) at the\nbeginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting\nHTML header level.\n\nBlockquotes are indicated using email-style '`>`' angle brackets.\n\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3\n#### Header 4\n##### Header 5\n###### Header 6\n\nA First Level Header\n====================\n    \nA Second Level Header\n---------------------\n\nNow is the time for all good men to come to\nthe aid of their country. This is just a\nregular paragraph.\n\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy\ndog's back.\n    \n> This is a blockquote.\n> \n> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.\n>\n> ## This is an H2 in a blockquote\n\n\n\n### Phrase Emphasis ###\n\nMarkdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.\n\nSome of these words *are emphasized*.\nSome of these words _are emphasized also_.\n    \nUse two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.\nOr, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.\n\n\n## Lists ##\n\nUnordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,\n`+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are\ninterchangeable:\n\n* Candy.\n+ Gum.\n- Booze.\n\nOrdered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as\nlist markers:\n\n1. Red\n2. Green\n3. Blue\n\n### Links ###\n\nMarkdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and\n*reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the\ntext you want to turn into a link.\n\nInline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.\nFor example:\n\nThis is an [example link](http://example.com/).\n\nOptionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:\n\nThis is an [example link](http://example.com/ \"With a Title\").\n\nReference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which\nyou define elsewhere in your document:\n\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from\n[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].\n\n[1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\n[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\"\n[3]: http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\"\n\n### Images ###\n\nImage syntax is very much like link syntax.\n\nInline (titles are optional):\n\n![Screenshot of Free Code Camp Calculator](https://github.com/bwyan/fcc-assets/blob/master/portfolio/fcc-calc@2x.png?raw=true \"My Free Code Camp Calculator\")\n\n### Code ###\n\nIn a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in\nbacktick quotes. Any ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` or\n`>`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes\nit easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:\n\nI strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.\n\nI wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`\ninstead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.\n\nTo specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of\nthe block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&`, `<`,\nand `>` characters will be escaped automatically.\n\n    <p>If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,\n    you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:</p>\n    \n    <pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    </code></pre>\n\n"
